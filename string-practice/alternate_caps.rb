# Given a string, write a function that returns a copy of the original string that has every other character capitalized. (Capitalization should begin with the second character.)

#     Input: “hello, how are your porcupines today?”
#     Output: “hElLo, HoW ArE YoUr pOrCuPiNeS ToDaY?”

# 1. Write a function to input a string
#  2. Iterate through the string 
# 3. As your method iterates, put every two letters to a capital letter
# 4. Increment by two as your iterate
